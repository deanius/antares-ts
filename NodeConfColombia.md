Speaker Bio:

I had the fortune in the late 90's to work on my Spanish minor and begin my web development career, while on a study abroad program in Madrid. I'm a full-stacker, whose progression has been from the back-end to the front-end. I've taught classes, run my own company, and developed a niche for myself in streaming and real-time technologies. I love the front-end, JS, React, and RxJS for the exciting experiences they help me bring to users, and I love sharing knowledge to empower people to build their dreams!

Additional notes
While I don't intend to juggle during every talk, I have done so before and can do so again on request! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyz3tAI6GaI&t=32

Also, while I have taught classes in Excel in Spanish/English, I'd probably have to speak in English only to deliver a long-form talk. I'm open to input here as well, let me know!
